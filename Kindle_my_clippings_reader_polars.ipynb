        "This is version 2, updated to handle the multi-line quotes in the Kindle Scribe and Paperwhite. Thanks to Alexander Beedie and Julian Cologne for their Github assistance on a read_csv() misadventure (https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/14300). Unfortunately, I was not able to use Alexander Beedie's elegant polars script as it assumes fixed line lengths (which the Scribe and then Paperwhite broke with their irregular line lengths).\n",
        "\n",
        "Lessons:\n",
        "1. read_csv() is a hack that requires the ideal separator, \"/x08\": this backspace/delete command works brilliantly (but I used read_table() instead).\n",
        "2. pd.read_table() updated in version 2 seems to work and does not need a choice of the right separator\n",
        "3. asking chatGPT was a mistake (it suggested read_csv())\n",
        "4. polars was dangerous because my inept read_csv() worked without error message but failed to load the entire file! read_csv() in pandas threw up error messages--which points to why polars failed to read the whole file; fortunately, I double checked, eventually, the dataframe and noticed the missing rows\n",
        "5. what I thought was a .unique() error was in fact the polars script failing to account for non-fixed length categories (an old problem); hence my verbose and convoluted old algo is still needed; always check the full printout (even if thousands of items long)\n",
        "6. the Pandas version is just as fast as the polars version in real life\n",
