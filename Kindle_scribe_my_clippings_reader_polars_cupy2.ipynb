A separate notebook, `oxford dictionary lookup.ipynb` automatically looks up the definition of words using the Oxford dictionary API (which you will need to register for and obtain). While the API is free, there are limits to the number of words that can be looked up.\n",

If this Jupyter notebook has not been run before, the `Kindle_scribe_vocab_updated.csv` file will not exist and the notebook will look for a base vocabulary file (`2DoList.csv`) failing which it will load up a blank.csv file.

Companies offering generative-AI services are required to identify and report “illegal content”. They must also adhere to China’s “core socialist values”, a sweeping and ambiguous command. After netizens spotted that a prompt for a “patriotic cat” in Ernie’s drawing application produced a picture of a feline with an American flag, the words “patriotism” and “patriotic cat” were blocked in the tool. Users may be put off by what Chinese AI cannot say, or fearful of being reported for asking the wrong questions.

            " alongside his lawyers in the ceremonial courtroom as the proceedings got under way. James, a Democrat, is seeking a range of sanctions that would prevent Trump from doing business in New York or with other institutions in the state. She already secured a sweeping pretrial ruling last week that ordered the cancellation of business certificates that Trump needs to operate in New York. In that decision, Engoron found that James already had proved a key fraud allegation. He is deciding the case without a jury. James sued Trump a year ago, the first in a series of legal dominoes to fall against the former president as he has been building another run for the White House. He is now facing criminal charges in four separate cases, including one in a nearby courthouse scheduled for trial in late March that centers on hush-money payments to a porn star. There are six claims remaining in the civil trial, relating to insurance fraud, conspiracy and falsifying documents. Those claims require the attorney general to demonstrate that the false valuations mattered and that Trump acted with fraudulent intent, the judge has said. During opening statements, Kevin Wallace, a lawyer in James’s office, told the justice that the state could meet that standard. “There is ample evidence of intent based on the defendant’s knowing, intentional lies,” Wallace said, adding that the falsities mattered because they allowed the Trump business to obtain better interest rates on loans and other benefits.

In all, 33 states assess annual EV fees, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Meanwhile, seven states levy a tax on electricity at EV charging stations. At the federal level, Senate Republicans led by Deb Fischer of Nebraska have introduced the “Stop EV Freeloading Act,” which would impose a $1,000 one-time fee on new EVs and an additional $550 on those weighing over 1,000 pounds.

Henry threatens civilians with appalling prospects of rape and murder and casually orders the massacre of prisoners. In the biggest hoodwinking of all, he tells his soldiers that they and their noble superiors will be a “band of brothers” after the battle of Agincourt. But he quietly confides to the audience that they are fools, slaves and peasants who do not understand how he maintains the peace, while he fights an unnecessary war for his own glory.

Ford “attributes all evil to Jews or to the Jewish capitalists,” a close friend wrote in his diary after witnessing a late-night, round-the-campfire diatribe. Ford whined about “New York Jews” and railed about “Wall Street Kikes.” He even ordered his engineers to forgo the use of any brass in his Model T automobile, calling it “Jew metal.”\n",

            " https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html 2/3  “In today’s dynamic marketplace, brands have a plethora of platform choices at their disposal for precise audience  targeting,” she said. “Therefore, it is imperative for the stewards and proprietors of social platforms to exercise deliberate  discretion in all aspects, be it their personal beliefs or political stances, as these choices will inevitably undergo public  scrutiny.”  The organizations that have paused their ads on X range from political campaigns to fast food chains to tech giants,  according to the documents. Airbnb, for example, halted more than $1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads  worth more than $800,000, halting campaigns in U.S. and international markets. Both tech companies declined to comment.  Other large brands, including Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix, paused some of their campaigns. Netflix’s halted ads  were worth nearly $3 million, according to X’s estimates. Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix did not respond to requests  for comment.  Various subsidiaries of Microsoft have also stopped advertising — leading to a potential loss of more than $4 million in  revenue for X’s fourth quarter, based on the documents — as have Amazon’s units for books and music and one subsidiary of  Google. The search giant and some other brands that have paused spending, including NBC Universal, have continued to  post content on the platform without paying X to ensure it reaches a broad audience.  Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not return requests for comment.  On the NBC program “Meet the Press” last Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie called Mr. Musk’s  comment part of a recent outpouring of an “outrageous type of hate.”  “Whether it’s Elon Musk, whether it’s professors on our college campuses or students that they are misleading, or whether  it’s individuals who are speaking out in an antisemitic way on the streets of our cities,” he said.  Two days before Mr. Christie’s appearance, a super PAC supporting him, called Tell It Like It Is, pulled its advertising from  X, according to the documents. A representative for the political fund-raising group did not respond to a request for  comment.  In an internal meeting with employees at X this week, Ms. Yaccarino cut a defiant mood. She made no mention of Mr. Musk’s  endorsement of the antisemitic post and attributed the company’s problems to a report by the left-wing media watchdog  group Media Matters, which showed that ads on X from companies like IBM and Apple appeared next to posts promoting  white nationalist and Nazi content.  On Monday, after Mr. Musk called Media Matters “an evil organization,” X sued the group and argued that its report, which  was published after Mr. Musk’s statement, “manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass  safeguards and create images of X’s largest advertisers’ paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content.” Ms. Yaccarino has  blamed the Media Matters’ report for X’s declining ad sales.  “Kowtowing to external criticism or pressures is simply not how X will ever operate,” she wrote in an email to X employees  on Wednesday that was seen by The Times. “The people at X are free speech defenders. We stand in solidarity with those  who believe in this fundamental right and the critical checks and balances of a thriving democracy.”  Earlier this week, Mr. Musk spent time celebrating companies that have continued to advertise on X, including the National  Football League. Using a heart emoji, X’s billionaire owner said he loved the N.F.L. (The New York Times largely stopped  marketing on the platform in early 2023, though the company’s sports publication, The Athletic, has continued to purchase  ads, according to a spokesman.)  Mr. Musk also noted that the company would donate “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war  in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” The funding will include revenue from ads bought by  charity groups, news organizations and other groups that advertised content related to the conflict.  Following her boss, Ms. Yaccarino added to Mr. Musk’s original post with a plea.  “Lean in and help,” she wrote on X.\n",

Its $7 million market capitalization is less than the value of the $22 million Miami mansion that its founder, Travis VanderZanden, bought in 2021.\n",
