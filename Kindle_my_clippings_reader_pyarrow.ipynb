In June, Inflection AI , an A.I. start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., announced it had acquired 22,000 of Nvidia’s H100 chips. It also said it raised $1.3 billion from Microsoft, Nvidia and others. Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection’s chief executive, said in an interview that the company planned to spend at least 95 percent of the funds on GPUs. “It’s a seismic amount of compute,” he said. “It’s just eye-watering.” Other start-ups have asked him to share, he said, but the company is already at full capacity.   \n",

If you’re wondering why a chip company is taking over the S&P 500, even though internet pioneer Marc Andreessen told us in a 2011 essay that “software is eating the world,” it’s because Nvidia, like Apple, is a software company in disguise. CUDA is a software layer that optimizes Nvidia’s chips and allows customers to build applications. Its model libraries and network of experts aren’t easily replicated. I can’t tell you the processor speed or pixel count on my iPhone, but I can tell you that I get one every three years, and I’m not migrating 23,000 family photos and 4,300 videos to anything new.

UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri this past week went to $23 billion from $20.8 billion.

And Groq’s specialist chips, he said, are significantly quicker and cheaper to run than Nvidia’s or other chip companies’ offerings.   \n",
