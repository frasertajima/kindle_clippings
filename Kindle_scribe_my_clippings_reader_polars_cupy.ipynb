While the API is free, there are limits to the number of words that can be looked up.\n",

If this Jupyter notebook has not been run before, the `Kindle_scribe_vocab_updated.csv` file will not exist and the notebook will look for a base vocabulary file (`2DoList.csv`) failing which it will load up a blank.csv file.
